Last update: Mar 25

- 0323_22_seeded: error control of the seeded matching; statement and proof are valid for small r_0 cases.

- 0322_22_seeded(deleted): incomplete; error control of the seeded matching. 

- 0321_22_cleanup: theoretical guarantee for the non-iterative clean up.

- 0306_22_proof_v2: revised version of 0306_22_proof based on Chanwoo's comments; count true pairs in S with high probability.

- 0318_22_conj1: try to prove Conjecture 1.

- 0309_22_smallsimulation: issues about the simulation setups, and the small scale simulation results for unseeded, seeded matching, and seeded matching with non-iterative clean up.

- 0306_22_proof: main theorems and proofs for the unseeded and seeded matching for Gaussian tensor matching. The accuracies for non-iterative clean up or post-processing are not included. Conjecture 1 needs to be verified.

- 0204 -- 0222_22: general ideas for Gaussian tensor matching.
