- 0309_22_smallsimulation: issues about the simulation setups, and the small scale simulation results for unseeded, seeded matching, and seeded matching with non-iterative clean up.

- 0306_22_proof: main theorems and proofs for the unseeded and seeded matching for Gaussian tensor matching. The accuracies for non-iterative clean up or post-processing are not included. Conjecture 1 needs to be verified.

- 0204 -- 0222_22: general ideas for Gaussian tensor matching.
