1. set.seed() option has been suppressed in the sim.data().

2. Initialization scheme in the current version of main function tensor_regress1 has been changed. Linear HOSVD --> random initialization. 

In future, should do:

3. Change the name of output quantities to be meaningful. Do not use C_ts, U, etc... Use core tensor, factor matrix,...
