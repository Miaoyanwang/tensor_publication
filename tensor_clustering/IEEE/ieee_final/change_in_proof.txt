Answers to the Queries: 

AQ1 & AQ2: The funding information is not correct in the first footnote. It should be ``… supported in part by NSF under Grant CAREER DMS-2141865, Grant DMS…”; CAREER is the term that refers to the NSF Faculty Early Career Development Program and is not the acronym.  

AQ3: The official citation of the earlier version at the AISTATS conference is: Hu, J. and Wang, M. (2022)``Multiway Spherical Clustering via Degree-Corrected Tensor Block Models.” Proceedings of The 25th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistic, PMLR 151:1078-1119, 2022. 
(Official citation is the best identification information I could find for this conference publication.)

AQ4: The Associate Editor information is correct.

AQ5: The acknowledgment is correct.
